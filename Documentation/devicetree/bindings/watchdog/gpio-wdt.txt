* Generic GPIO-triggered watchdog

This driver can be used for simple external chips that can be triggered by
a GPIO pin. Currently support is limited to GPIO controllers that support
non-sleeping operations.

Required properties:
- compatible: must be "generic,gpio-wdt".
- gpios: gpio pin to use
- ping-sec: how often to ping the watchdog before userspace watchdog daemon
  is started,
- timeout-sec: watchdog timeout that is reported to userspace.

Example:

max6369 {
	compatible = "generic,gpio-wdt";
	gpios = <&pioB 13 0>;
	ping-sec = <5>;
	timeout-sec = <60>;
};
