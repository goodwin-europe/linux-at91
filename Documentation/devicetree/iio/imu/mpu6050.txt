* InvenSense MPU 6050 MEMS (gyro + accelerometer)

This driver also works with MEMS 9150 device.

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be "invensense,mpu6050"
- reg: i2c address
- interrupts: interrupt description
- orientation: array of 9 values that specifies 3x3 rotation matrix that is
               applied to convert data from chip orientation to device
			   orientation. Permitted values are -1, 0, 1.

Optional properties:
- i2c-bypass: enable I2C bypass mode. When this option is defined, auxiliary
              I2C interface is connected to main I2C interface.

Examples:

	mpu6050: mpu6050@68 {
		compatible = "invensense,mpu6050";
		reg = <0x68>;
		interrupts = <29 1>;
		orientation = <1   0   0
		               0 (-1)  0
		               0   0 (-1)>;
		i2c-bypass;
	};
